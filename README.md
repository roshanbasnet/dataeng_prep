# Data Engineering and Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects related to data engineering and data analysis. These projects were undertaken during my preparation for a career in data engineering and data analysis. The projects cover various topics and tools, including Power BI, Pyspark, Uber Data Analytics, ETL data pipelines, BigQuery, and data visualization using Looker.

## **[Power BI Projects](https://github.com/roshanbasnet/dataeng_prep/tree/main/PowerBI)**
1. ### Data Professional Survey
This project is based on the knowledge gained from the @Alextheanalyst YouTube channel. It involves the analysis and visualization of data from a survey conducted among data professionals. The aim of the project is to gain insights into the preferences and trends within the data industry.

2. ### International Strategic Opportunities Program
In this project, I worked on analyzing and visualizing data related to an international strategic opportunities program. The project utilizes Power BI to explore and present data insights, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## **[Pyspark Projects](https://github.com/roshanbasnet/dataeng_prep/tree/main/PySpark)**
This section covers projects related to Pyspark, which is a powerful data processing framework.

* Basics of Pyspark and RDD
In this project, I focused on learning the fundamentals of Pyspark and RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets). I implemented various data analysis tasks using Pyspark, exploring its capabilities for distributed computing and data manipulation.

## **[Uber Data Analytics | End-To-End Data Engineering Project](https://github.com/roshanbasnet/dataeng_prep/tree/main/UberDataAnalysis)**
This project, inspired by Darshil Palmar, involves building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for Uber data analytics. The project encompasses the following key aspects:

* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline**: I implemented an ETL pipeline to extract data from different sources, transform it to a suitable format, and load it into a target data storage system.
* Mage.ai: The project utilizes Mage.ai, a data engineering platform, to streamline the development and deployment of the data pipeline.
* **BigQuery**: The transformed data is stored in BigQuery, a highly scalable and fully-managed data warehouse provided by Google Cloud.
* **Data Visualization**: Looker is used to visualize and explore the data, providing intuitive dashboards and interactive visualizations for better data insights.
Each project is contained in its respective directory within this repository, with detailed documentation and code samples. Feel free to explore the individual project directories for more information.
